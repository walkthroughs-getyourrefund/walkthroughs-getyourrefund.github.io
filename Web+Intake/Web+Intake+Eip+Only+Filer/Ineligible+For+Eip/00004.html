        <div>
            <p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, the federal government has sent out two rounds of Economic Impact Payments (often called a stimulus check). For the first round, individuals received up to $1,200 for themselves ($2,400 for a married couple filing jointly) and an additional $500 for every dependent child under the age of 17.</p>
            <p>For the second round, individuals receive up to $600 for themselves ($1,200 for a married couple filing jointly) and an additional $600 for every dependent child under the age of 17. If you have not yet received either rounds of payments yet, it is not too late! You can still claim them by filing a tax return this year.</p>
        </div>
        <p>We know there are many questions around the Economic Impact Payments (EIP) and we have some answers! We’ve broken down some common questions to help you out.</p>
        <p class="hint">

        <h2 class="h3">Who is eligible?</h2>
        <div class="last">
            <p>There are different eligibility levels for the two rounds of stimulus checks. For the first round, tax filers with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 for individuals and up to $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns will receive the full payment. For filers with income above those amounts, the payment amount is reduced by $5 for each $100 above the $75,000/$150,000 thresholds. Single filers with income exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers with no children are not eligible.</p>
            <p>For the first round, eligible taxpayers received an economic impact payment of up to $1,200 for individuals or $2,400 for married couples and up to $500 for each qualifying child.</p>
            <p>For the second round, income tax filers with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 for individuals and up to $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns will again receive the full payment. For filers with income above those amounts, the payment amount phases out more quickly than in the first round. Single filers with income exceeding $87,000 and $174,000 for joint filers with no children are not eligible.</p>
            <p>For the second round, eligible taxpayers will receive an economic impact payment of up to $600 for individuals or $1,200 for married couples and up to $600 for each qualifying child.</p>
            <p>If you have any earned income or dependents, you may be able to access additional tax credits or benefits by filing or updating your info with the IRS. Please reach out via chat for more information.</p>

        <div class="last">
            <p>Originally, mixed status families were not eligible for the first round of payments. However, now mixed status families can claim both the first and second round of payments on this year’s tax return. For the second round of payments, if you jointly file with your spouse and only one of you has a valid Social Security Number, the spouse with the valid SSN will receive up to $600 and up to $600 for any qualifying children with SSNs. However, the spouse without a valid SSN is not eligible. The same rules now apply for the first round of payments as well.</p>
